<h1><center>Version Control System</center></h1>
<p><center>Version control systems are a category of software tools that
  helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications
  done to the code. Using it, the developers can work together on code and
  separate their tasks through branches.Multiple people can work simultaneously
  on a single project. Everyone works on
  and edits their own copy of the files and it is up to them when they wish to share
  the changes made by them with the rest of the team.</center></p>
<p><center>Version control provides access to the historical versions of a project. This
  is insurance against computer crashes or data loss. If any mistake is made, you
  can easily roll back to a previous version. It is also possible to undo specific
  edits that too without losing the work done in the meanwhile. It can be easily
  known when, why, and by whom any part of a file was edited.</center></p>
<h2><center>Git and GitHub</center></h2>
<p><center>Simply put, Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of
  your source code history.</center></p>
<p><center>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
  If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.</center></p>
<h2>Git Commands</h2>
<dl>
  <dt style="color:#4d4d00"><strong> 1. git init-</strong></dt>
  <dd>This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first step in creating a repository.
    After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.</dd>
  <br>
  <dt style="color:#4d4d00"><strong> 2. git commit-</strong></dt>
  <dd>Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has a unique ID.
      Itâ€™s best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit. Adding a
      commitmessage helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes.</dd>
  <br>
  <dt style="color:#4d4d00"><strong> 3. git merge-</strong></dt>
  <dd>Integrate branches together. git merge combines the changes from one branch to another branch.
    For example, merge the changes made in a staging branch into the stable branch.</dd>
